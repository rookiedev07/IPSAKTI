    text: "Section 3(p) of the Indian Patents Act, 1970 excludes from patentability any invention that is, in effect, traditional knowledge, or that is an aggregation or duplication of known properties of traditionally known components. This was written specifically to stop biopiracy claims over India's traditional medicine systems, including Ayurveda. Courts have applied this broadly: even combining single traditionally-known ingredients into a new mixture has been found non-patentable if each ingredient's use and property was already documented in traditional sources. Only genuine, non-obvious improvements over traditional formulations that meet novelty and inventive step requirements can be patented.",
